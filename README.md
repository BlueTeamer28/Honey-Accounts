# Honey-Accounts
This document will walk you through how to use Microsoft's free developer account and free Azure accounts to make honey accounts. It will also teach you how to use a logic app that will send an email notifying you that the honey account has been used and the IP address that was used to sign into the account. This will work with paid accounts as well, and if you currently use Microsoft Sentinel as your SEIM provider. The goal for this project is to enter the honey credentials into phishing credential harvester websites and wait for your logic app to send you an email containing the IP address of the sign-in attempt. Then, take the IP address of the sign-in attempt and use it for additional threat hunting in your environment, for example you could use it to query sign-in logs and filter on only that IP address and see if any accounts have been compromised to the credential harvester.
